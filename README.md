Explanation of Concepts:

1. **Class and Object**:
   - **Class**: `Animal`, `BankAccount`, `Shape`, etc. A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods common to all objects of the class.
   - **Object**: `dog`, `cat`, `account`, `circle`, etc. An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with its own attributes and behaviors.

2. **Constructor and Instance Variables**:
   - The `__init__` method is a special method used to initialize an object. It sets initial values for the object's attributes (`name`, `age`, `breed`, `balance`, etc.).

3. **Class Variable**:
   - `num_of_animals` is a class variable shared among all instances of the class `Animal`.

4. **Instance Method**:
   - `speak()` is an instance method. It's a behavior associated with an instance of a class. It's defined in the `Animal` class and overridden in the `Dog` and `Cat` classes.

5. **Class Method**:
   - `get_num_of_animals()` is a class method. It operates on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. It's used to access or modify class-level attributes.

6. **Inheritance**:
   - `Dog` inherits from `Animal`. It's a mechanism by which one class can inherit the attributes and methods from another class.

7. **Method Override**:
   - `speak()` is overridden in the `Dog` and `Cat` classes to provide specific behavior for each subclass.

8. **Encapsulation**:
   - `BankAccount` encapsulates the `balance` variable and provides methods (`deposit` and `withdraw`) to interact with it.

9. **Abstraction**:
   - `Shape` is an abstract class. It defines the method `area`, which must be implemented by its subclasses.

10. **Polymorphism**:
    - `Dog` and `Cat` have different implementations of `speak()`, but they are called in the same way.

11. **Composition**:
    - `Person` has a `pet` which can be an instance of any subclass of `Animal`.

12. **Aggregation**:
    - `Department` has a list of `employees`. It aggregates instances of the `Person` class.

13. **Instantiating Objects**:
    - Creating instances of classes using `dog = Dog(...)`, `cat = Cat(...)`, etc.

14. **Using Objects**:
    - Invoking methods and accessing attributes of objects.

15. **Print Results**:
    - Displaying the results of method calls and operations.

16. **Demonstrating Inheritance**:
    - Using the class method `get_num_of_animals()` to get the total number of animals.

17. **Demonstrating Composition**:
    - Creating a `Person` with a `pet`.

18. **Demonstrating Aggregation**:
    - Creating a `Department` and adding employees to it.
